# Jennifer Eckenrode Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

I created this webpage all on my own for the sole purpose of seeing it all the way through, proving to myself that I could do it! If I can do it, so can you! I believe that is the basis in learning to code for yourself: knowing anything is possible. This guide provides a way for students like myself to refer to notes on the building blocks of webpage development in an interactive, easy to read display. Students referring to my webpage will find helpful and quick tips that we students are all on the same track to using, making the process of learning to code a community effort for all of us! Building this webpage helped me to learn the basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript! I know entirely more about how to identify, debug, and problem-solve through the webpage development process than I did before starting this prework guide.
