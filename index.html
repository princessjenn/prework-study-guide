        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> An element refers to everything inside an opening and closing tag. </li>
          <li> Tag refers to everything inside the angle brackets in an HTML file. </li>
          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage, or metadata, which contains important info about accessibility, search engines, and performance. </li>
          <li> The title element is the title for the webpage. It is extremely important to SEO, or search engine optimization. </li>
          <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
          <li> Semantic elements make content easier to read. </li>
          <li> Child elements are elements nested inside other elements. </li>
          <li> Parent elements are elements that hold all of the child elements. </li>
          <li> The section element defines a section in a document that contains thematic content. </li>
          <li> The footer element appears at the bottom of the page, and usually contains the author, copyright, contacts, sitemap, and navigation. </li>
          <li> The style element defines CSS styles associated with the website. </li>
          <li> The base element defines the base URL for the webpage. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> CSS is programming that adds color and style to a webpage. </li>
          <li> CSS defines how colors, aesthetics, visual loyout, and organization of content is presented to users. </li>
          <li> Inline CSS applies to a specific HTML tag using a style attribute to style a particular page element only. </li>
          <li> Internal CSS applies CSS rules for a webpage in the head section of an HTML file, and the rules apply only to that page. </li>
          <li> External CSS is the most common way to style, and allow developers to keep all CSS rules in a seperate file, making design changes easier. </li>
          <li> A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. </li>
          <li> A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. </li>
          <li> Every HTML element is essentially in a box, referred to as the CSS box model, which consists of margins outside of the element, the element's borders, padding, and content. </li>
          <li> The selector defines the elements attributes to which the rules, or declarations, apply. </li>
          <li> Declarations cointain two components: the CSS property we want to apply, and the value of that property. </li>
          <li> Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including semantic color words, or by the hexadecimal number. </li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Git is an open-source control system that allows developers to collaborate on projects without over-writing work.</li>
          <li> It allows reverting back to previous version of code if a problem is discovered. </li>
          <li> Github is the largest provider of internet hosting for software and web development code within a central repository (singular storage for all data) </li>
          <li> A repository, or repo, is a project folder for all files that make up a repo. </li>
          <li> A branch is a git workspace where you can make changes to your code without affecting the live site.</li>
          <li> Git commands are what will instruct your computer to do with files logged into your local or remote branches in your terminal. </li>
          <li> git status: checks what branch we are currently on. </li>
          <li> git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it. </li>
          <li> git commit: commiting changes, or saving a version of a file you're working on.</li>
          <li> git add [file]: add a file as it looks now to your next commit. </li>
          <li> git merge [branch]: merge the specified branch's history into the current one. </li>
          <li> git push [branch]: transmits local branch commits to the remote repository branch. </li>
          <li> git pull: fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch. </li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Javascript is programming that allows users to interact with webpages. </li>
          <li> You can power websites with interactivity, affects, data communication, etc. </li>
          <li> A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. </li>
          <li> A string includes all of the topics you want in your variable. </li>
          <li> To access the string, simply refer to the variable name. </li>
          <li> The console is where the variable will output a message, and works as a test environment to test code. </li>
          <li> Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script (top to bottom). </li>
          <li> Developers can instruct a program to deviate from the normal linear flow by writing certain conditions for the code to meet. </li>
          <li> Conditions tell app what to do and when to do it based on the condition of your choosing. </li>
          <li> An array is a group of related data. </li>
          <li> A data item's location number is called an index. </li>
          <li> for loops perform tasks on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. </li>
          <li> Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific tasks. </li>
          <li> To execute functions, we must always call them in the linear order as we would want them to execute. 
          <li> Order matters, as the control flow dictates that Javascipt files are executed from top to bottom. </li>
